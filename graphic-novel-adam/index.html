      <h3>Briefing</h3>
      
      <p>For the topic of Graphic Novel, our task was to develop in small groups a coherent visual story with the help of AI-generated images using tools such as Midjourney. The finished website was supposed to have a navigative and user-friendly layout, and it was especially important to design the website to be responsive.

      <h3>Concept</h3>
     
      <p>
        When we started working on the concept, our group first focused on the story itself. We wanted to reinterpret “Kiss the Frog.” The main question was how such a situation could arise nowadays, that is, a woman kisses frogs. And what consequences this would bring with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The images themselves, with which this story is then told, were supposed to have a rather dark Marvel-comic-like look, consisting of very strong contrasts and clear outlines. The overall design of the website was supposed to be structured like a book. 
      </p>

      <h3>Development</h3>
     
      <p>
        We first started working with the image generation option of ChatGPT in order to quickly visualize our idea. In fact, we found the results so satisfactory that we simply stuck with this tool.</p>

        <p>  Our group wrote out the individual scenes and then sorted which content should go on the different pages. We then had whole pages generated, which we could, if necessary, adjust afterwards, but it prevented the characters from differing too much from one image to another.</p>

        <p> Texts and small adjustments we then changed digitally afterwards. The responsiveness we implemented by displaying a double page on desktop and a single page on mobile screens.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>The process of finding ideas was very easy for us and was quickly done. Also, dealing with our chosen AI (ChatGPT) was simple, and we could basically start directly with the implementation of the image creation. In the group, the organization and division of tasks worked well, which helped us to finish the project quickly and then rather focus more on the fine-tuning.</p>

  <p>However, the image generation option in Chat was not infallible either. The pages and especially the character design did not remain really consistent, which of course was also due to the fact that we divided up the different parts of the story. Although we tried to keep each other constantly updated on our progress, this way of working still led to some deviations, for example in the visual age of the main character. But the tool also had difficulties displaying text and very long loading times, which slowed down our workflow a bit.</p>

  <p>Even though we heard from other groups that other tools also did not work flawlessly, I could imagine trying alternative AIs if I had to generate images again. I would also create a pre-made prompt for image generation from the beginning, which the whole group could use, so that more coordinated results could be produced.</p>
